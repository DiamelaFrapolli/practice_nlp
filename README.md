NLP Practice
This repository contains practice exercises from a YouTube course that I am following. The course is from the [CÃ³digo Espinoza - Automatiza tu vida], and you can find it here:

Please note that most of the exercises and content in this repository are not my own (except for some exceptions); they are part of the course material. 
I am using this repository for practice and learning purposes only, and you can use it as well if you need it!
